    <h1 class="h1-about">Elizabeth Alexandra Mary</h1>
    <p class="about-paragraphs">
      Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926) is Queen of
      the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth realms.
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraphs">
      Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, as the first child of the Duke and
      Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth). Her father
      ascended the throne on the abdication of his brother King Edward VIII in
      1936, from which time she was the heir presumptive. She was educated
      privately at home and began to undertake public duties during the Second
      World War, serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In 1947, she
      married Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a former prince of Greece and Denmark,
      with whom she had four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne, Princess
      Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.

    <p class="about-paragraphs">
      When her father died in February 1952, Elizabeth – then 25 years old –
      became head of the Commonwealth and queen regnant of seven independent
      Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New
      Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon. She has reigned as a
      constitutional monarch through major political changes, such as devolution
      in the United Kingdom, accession of the United Kingdom to the European
      Communities, Brexit, Canadian patriation, and the decolonisation of
      Africa. Between 1956 and 1992, the number of her realms varied as
      territories gained independence, and as realms, including South Africa,
      Pakistan, and Ceylon (renamed Sri Lanka), became republics. Her many
      historic visits and meetings include a state visit to the Republic of
      Ireland and visits to or from five popes. Significant events have included
      her coronation in 1953 and the celebrations of her Silver, Golden, and
      Diamond Jubilees in 1977, 2002, and 2012, respectively. In 2017, she
      became the first British monarch to reach a Sapphire Jubilee. In 2021,
      after 73 years of marriage, her husband Prince Philip died at the age of
      99.
    </p>
    <p class="about-paragraphs">
      Elizabeth is the longest-lived and longest-reigning British monarch, the
      longest-serving female head of state in world history, the world's oldest
      living monarch, longest-reigning current monarch, and oldest and
      longest-serving current head of state. Elizabeth has occasionally faced
      republican sentiments and press criticism of the royal family, in
      particular after the breakdown of her children's marriages, her annus
      horribilis in 1992, and the death in 1997 of her former daughter-in-law
      Diana, Princess of Wales. However, support for the monarchy in the United
      Kingdom has been and remains consistently high, as does her personal
      popularity.

    <h3>Early life</h3>
    <p class="about-paragraphs">
      Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born at 02:40 (GMT) on 21 April 1926,
      during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King George V. Her father,
      the Duke of York (later King George VI), was the second son of the King.
      Her mother, the Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother),
      was the youngest daughter of Scottish aristocrat Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th
      Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. She was delivered by Caesarean section
      at her maternal grandfather's London house: 17 Bruton Street, Mayfair. She
      was baptised by the Anglican Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, in the
      private chapel of Buckingham Palace on 29 May, and named Elizabeth after
      her mother; Alexandra after George V's mother, who had died six months
      earlier; and Mary after her paternal grandmother. Called "Lilibet" by her
      close family, based on what she called herself at first, she was cherished
      by her grandfather, George V, whom she affectionately called "Grandpa
      England", and during his serious illness in 1929 her regular visits were
      credited in the popular press and by later biographers with raising his
      spirits and aiding his recovery.

    <p class="about-paragraphs">
      Elizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two
      princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother and
      their governess, Marion Crawford. Lessons concentrated on history,
      language, literature, and music. Crawford published a biography of
      Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled The Little Princesses in
      1950, much to the dismay of the royal family. The book describes
      Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude of
      responsibility. Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill
      described Elizabeth when she was two as "a character. She has an air of
      authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant." Her cousin
      Margaret Rhodes described her as "a jolly little girl, but fundamentally
      sensible and well-behaved".
